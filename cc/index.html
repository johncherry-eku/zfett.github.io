		<h1>About ColonelCraft</h1>
		<p><b>ColonelCraft</b> is a private, survival multi-player Minecraft server for EKU students, by EKU students! We are a self-ran, non-official student group that wants to create a platform where any student can play together at any time, any day, anywhere. With our group, there is no official meeting place, no BYO-Device rules, and no set meeting times. All you need is a legal copy of Java Minecraft and an Internet connection!</p>
		<p><b>ColonelCraft</b> is currently in a beta state. As such, our server will be private and limited to a max of 12 players on the roster until we either gain an official student group status with EKU, or we gain enough donations to upgrade the server to a higher plan to allow more players to join. Until either or both of those requirements are met, <b>ColonelCraft</b> will remain whitelisted to a small roster of players.</p>
		<p>Interested in joining? Fill out the form below and you could be a part of the first 12 players to join <b>ColonelCraft</b>! Act quick, as once the 12 slots fill up, the form will close and submissions will no longer be accepted!</p>
