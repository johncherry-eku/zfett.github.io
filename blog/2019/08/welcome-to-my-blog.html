	<p>I'm really just writing this post so this blog can have some content. It's better than a boring, expectable <i>lorem ipsum</i> boilerplate.</p>
	<p>Just to fill this page up a bit, hello, my name is Zachary and I'm currently attending college to get my bachelorate in business administration for general computer information systems. I've been a long-time HTML & CSS front-end developer and I'm starting to broaden my horizons even more to cover my bases for when I start to seek a career job.</p>
	<p>This blog will mainly contain things related to cool developments and tricks I discover in my programming ventures, as well as anything else that comes to mind.</p>
	<p><i>Welcome to the container of my uncategorized thoughts.</i><a href="../../index.html"><span class="tag">GO HOME</span></a></p>
